# How to Start the bot:

 - Install NodeJS
 - Open your terminal/cmd, navigate to the bot folder and write [> `npm i`]
 - Fill `config.json` with your data, instead of the demo data written in it. (it is in the JSON format)
 - Open your terminal/cmd, navigate to the bot folder and write [> `node bot.js`]


Alternatively, you can write a simple endless loop script that tries to restart the bot on failure.
    (failures occur if your internet connection breaks, or if the STEEM server is offline, as well as other problems)
